      "Clinic Letter": "Date: [Insert Date]\n\nDear Dr. [General Practitioner's Last Name],\n\nRe: Mrs. [Patient's Last Name], DOB: [Patient's DOB], NHS Number: [Patient's NHS Number]\n\nDiagnosis: Breast Cancer, post mastectomy, Breast Reconstruction Consultation\nI had the opportunity to see Mrs. [Patient's Last Name] in clinic on [date of consultation], regarding her options for breast reconstruction following right mastectomy for breast cancer.\n\nHistory: Mrs. [Patient's Last Name], aged 51, has a history of hypertension, managed with atorvastatin, ramipril, furosemide, and potassium supplements. Her surgical history includes uterine fibroids removal, cyst excision on foot, and cataract surgery. Recently, she was diagnosed with breast cancer in her right breast, identified through mammogram, ultrasound, and needle biopsy.\n\nExamination: She is moderately overweight with significant breast hypertrophy bilaterally. The abdomen presents as suitable for a potential TRAM flap reconstruction.\n\nClinical Summary: We discussed her reconstruction options extensively. Given her body habitus and potential for postoperative radiation, we decided against tissue expander reconstruction. She showed a preference for TRAM flap reconstruction over latissimus dorsi with implant, understanding the recovery process and potential complications.\n\nPlan: We plan to proceed with TRAM flap reconstruction synchronously with her mastectomy. A vascular delay procedure is scheduled shortly, contingent on her postoperative care plan.\n\nActions for GP: Please continue monitoring her blood pressure and general health. Pre-operative optimisation of her hypertension and general wellbeing would be beneficial.\nI will keep you updated on her surgical dates and any further developments.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Signature] [Consultant's Full Name] [Consultant's GMC Number]\n\nDistribution List:\nMrs. [Patient's Last Name] (patient)\nDr. ABC (Consulting Surgeon)\n[Any Other Relevant Party]",
